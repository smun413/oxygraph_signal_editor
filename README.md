This is a Matlab based GUI for signal processing and points re marking for the signals extracted from Oraboros O2k oxygraph.
It has the following steps
1. Extract Chamber A/B O2 signals --> 2. Mark reperfusion regions --> 3. Remove  reperfusion regions --> 4. Mark titration points --> 5. Save them to points.txt/ points.m file

   This can be used by the signal plot file.
